## Description
The main objectives for this assignment is to create a portfolio, using Bootstrap.
The code for the portfolio is to consist of a responsive layout including, a nav
bar and responsive images. The use of media queries discussed in week two should
be kept to a minimum. The use of Bootstrap's grid system is highly reccomended, which includes containers, rows and columns. 
The website should be able to accomadate smaller screen sizes, for instance a cell phone and should also
be presentable on a larger desktop. The nav bar must be consistant on each page
and pertain the right functionality. It is important that every link is functional. Using secamic Html from week 1 is also important for the portfolio.
The use of personal information on the contact page is important to include for
employers. A useful tip for employers to see is commiting often; showing progress and dedication towards the field.
